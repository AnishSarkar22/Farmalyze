## üå± Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in economic development, especially in countries like India, where a large portion of the population depends on farming for livelihood. Leveraging **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **IoT**, this project aims to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions.

This web-based platform includes three key applications:
- üåæ Crop Recommendation
- üíä Fertilizer Suggestion
- ü¶† Plant Disease Detection

## üöÄ Applications

### üåæ Crop Recommendation System
- **Input**: Soil N-P-K values, State, and City
- **Output**: Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and local weather data.
- **Note**:  
  - Enter N-P-K values as a ratio.  
  - Use well-known city names to ensure compatibility with the weather API.

---

### üíä Fertilizer Suggestion System
- **Input**: Soil nutrient values and selected crop
- **Output**: Recommends necessary fertilizers by identifying nutrient deficiencies or excesses in the soil.

---

### ü¶† Plant Disease Detection System
- **Input**: Image of a plant leaf
- **Output**: 
  - Identifies if the plant is healthy or diseased  
  - If diseased, provides:
    - Disease name  
    - Background information  
    - Treatment and prevention suggestions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently supports a limited number of crops.

## üíª How to Use

- **Crop Recommendation**  
  ‚û§ Enter N-P-K ratios along with your state and city. The system uses weather data to recommend the best crop.

- **Fertilizer Suggestion**  
  ‚û§ Provide the current nutrient levels of the soil and the crop you plan to grow. Get fertilizer suggestions to balance the soil.

- **Disease Detection**  
  ‚û§ Upload a clear image of the plant leaf. The system will detect the disease (if any) and provide relevant info and solutions.
